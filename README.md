# Robot-Gladiators

## Description

This is an MVP robot battle game built in JavaScript as part of a fictional hackathon, CON SOLO.   This contest is not to use any graphics or CSS and be the work of an individual coder.

- The motivation for producing this game is to learn JavaScript in a fun and hands-on manner.
